abstract = {It appears that the development of machine vision may benefit from a detailed understanding of the imaging process. The reflectance map, showing scene radiance as a function of surface gradient, has proved to be helpful in this endeavor. The reflectance map depends both on the nature of the surface layers of the objects being imaged and the distribution of light sources. Recently, a unified approach to the specification of surface reflectance in terms of both incident and reflected beam geometry has been proposed. The reflecting properties of a surface are specified in terms of the bidirectional reflectance-distribution function (BRDF). Here we derive the reflectance map in terms of the BRDF and the distribution of source radiance. A number of special cases of practical importance are developed in detail. The significance of this approach to the understanding of image formation is briefly indicated.}

abstract = {In this article, we describe a spectral sensitivity measurement procedure at the National Physical Laboratory, London, with the aim of obtaining ground truth spectral sensitivity functions for Nikon D5100 and Sigma SD1 Merill cameras. The novelty of our data is that the potential measurement errors are estimated at each wavelength. We determine how well the measured spectral sensitivity functions represent the actual camera sensitivity functions (as a function of wavelength). The second contribution of this paper is to test the performance of various leading sensor estimation techniques implemented from the literature using measured and synthetic data and also evaluate them based on ground truth data for the two cameras. We conclude that the estimation techniques tested are not sufficiently accurate when compared with our measured ground truth data and that there remains significant scope to improve estimation algorithms for spectral estimation. To help in this endeavor, we will make all our data available online for the community.}

abstract = {Estimation of the spectral characteristics of color image sensors is an important problem. The effective spectral response of a color imaging system may vary from the color filter specification for a variety of reasons. However, color correction and color constancy algorithms require precise characterization of the color filter response in order to attain accurate color reproduction. Also, camera systems need to be qualified and calibrated quickly in a manufacturing environment. CMOS image sensors, which are becoming more popular, complicate the problem, since noise levels on CMOS sensors have yet to equal their CCD counterparts. For these reasons, a fast and reliable characterization of the color sensor response is needed. This paper presents an approach to the problem using numerical regularization techniques. In particular, Tikhonov regularization is used to determine the spectral response of a color image sensor given the digital output codes from an image with known reflectances under a known illuminant.},

abstract = {To accurately predict the response of colour devices such as digital cameras to spectral stimuli their spectral sensitivities need to be known. In this paper we present a simple, flexible method for characterising such devices, based on a single image of aMacbeth Color Checker Chart.We begin by showing that device RGBs are linearly related to the Macbeth reflectances and that this linear relationship is defined by the spectral sensitivities of the device. It follows then that it should be possible to solve for these sensitivities by linear regression. However, this simple idea does notwork well in practice - recovered sensitivities are very different from the actual device sensitivities.The simple regression fails because the Macbeth reflectance set has limited dimensionality and so the regression is highly sensitive to image noise. To overcome this problem we incorporate a number of natural constraints: positivity, modality, and band-limitedness into the regression formulation. Each constraint can be written as a linear inequality and so solving for device sensitivities by this constrained regression is a quadratic programming problem. Posing the problem in this form, we can search for the sensors which best fit the data, quickly and efficiently, by trying different combinations of the linear constraints.The results of performing this constrained regression on a number of colour devices are presented here. In all cases our new technique recovers sensors which are very close to the actual device sensitivities and we are confident that these results will extrapolate to other colour devices.},

They are important for many computer vision tasks that use color information, such as multispectral imaging, color rendering, and color constancy. In this paper, we aim to explore the space of spectral sensitivity functions for digital color cameras. After collecting a database of 28 cameras covering a variety of types, we find this space convex and two-dimensional. Based on this statistical model, we propose two methods to recover camera spectral sensitivities using regular reflective color targets (e.g., color checker) from a single image with and without knowing the illumination. We show the proposed model is more accurate and robust for estimating camera spectral sensitivities than other basis functions. We also show two applications for the recovery of camera spectral sensitivities - simulation of color rendering for cameras and computational color constancy.},

abstract = {This paper describes the methodology developed for characterizing a commercial charge-coupled device (CCD) camera as a luminance meter for analyzing lighting systems and especially for measurements in road light plants. Today, several luminance meters based on commercial CCD cameras are on the market. They are very attractive for the lighting engineer: The availability of a high number of closely spaced small detectors (pixels) on a single chip permits analyses almost impossible with a traditional luminance meter. These commercial-industrial CCD cameras are sold at prices lower than scientific grade ones. They are factory equipped with a dedicated filter to reach the correct photopic sensitivity V(λ), and they are factory calibrated in luminance SI units. The main counterparts in using these cameras are in the difficulties to define the measurement accuracy and the influence of the environment luminance on the measured values of the framed scene, in the low resolution of their A/D converter (usually 8 or 12 bit), and the higher noise level (usually the CCD chip is not cooled). To reach the measurement accuracy required by lighting norms, it is necessary to characterize metrologically a camera and quantify all the possible external influences which could degrade its performances, in real measurement situations, and which could affect the measurement results. A carefully controlled measurement set up and operating procedure could limit the causes of errors and improve the accuracy of measurements obtained in operating conditions. In this way, the measurement uncertainties might be evaluated completely, and considerations on the results could suggest particular operating practices to limit the causes of error due to measurement setup and environmental conditions.},

The method is designed to overcome some undocumented aspects of the imager-characterization problem: The effective spectral sensitivity profiles of the imager's color channels depend on the level of radiant input energy, and these profiles must be known in order to determine the true intensity-response characteristics of the three channels. By fitting the response distributions of the three color channels explicitly with low-dimensional models, the method takes these dependencies into account, and may, therefore, offer several advantages over other imager-characterization methodologies, particularly where illuminant-independent characterization is required. An application of the technique is detailed, in which a CCD camera is characterized using only the Macbeth ColorChecker and a number of artificial illuminants. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

abstract = {This paper proposes a method to approximate the camera spectral sensitivity functions from a single colour image of a colour chart under an unknown illumination spectrum. Here we assume that the scene illumination has a smooth spectral variation. Although the original problem is rather ill-posed, we reformulate it as a well-posed optimisation one by introducing several constraints. The first constraint concerns with the smoothness of the illuminant power spectrum. The second one is based on the fact that the spectral sensitivity function of a digital camera should be constrained to a linear subspace according to Luther condition. The third constraint limits the influence of bands with low signal-to-noise ratios. By introducing these constraints, we can solve the problem in a coordinate-descent optimisation manner. We validate our method using data acquired from over 40 commercial camera models and compare with an alternative in the literature. We also demonstrate the utility of the estimated colour matching functions for colour simulation and colour transfer.},

abstract = {Knowing the RGB spectral sensitivities of a camera is useful for several image processing applications. However, camera manufacturers seldom provide this information. Calibration methods for determining them can be daunting, requiring either sophisticated instruments or carefully controlled lighting. This paper presents a quick and easy method that provides a reasonable approximation of the camera response functions with only a color chart and casual unknown illuminations. Our approach is enabled by careful design of the cost function that imposes several constraints on the problem to make it tractable. In the components of the cost function, the Luther condition provides the global shape prior and the commercial lighting systems with unknown spectra provide narrow spectral windows for local reconstruction. The quality of reconstruction is comparable with other methods that use known illumination.},

abstract = {Cameras record three color responses (RGB) which are device dependent. Camera coordinates are mapped to a standard color space, such as XYZ-useful for color measurement-by a mapping function, e.g., the simple 3×3 linear transform (usually derived through regression). This mapping, which we will refer to as linear color correction (LCC), has been demonstrated to work well in the number of studies. However, it can map RGBs to XYZs with high error. The advantage of the LCC is that it is independent of camera exposure. An alternative and potentially more powerful method for color correction is polynomial color correction (PCC). Here, the R, G, and B values at a pixel are extended by the polynomial terms. For a given calibration training set PCC can significantly reduce the colorimetric error. However, the PCC fit depends on exposure, i.e., as exposure changes the vector of polynomial components is altered in a nonlinear way which results in hue and saturation shifts. This paper proposes a new polynomial-type regression loosely related to the idea of fractional polynomials which we call root-PCC (RPCC). Our idea is to take each term in a polynomial expansion and take its kth root of each k-degree term. It is easy to show terms defined in this way scale with exposure. RPCC is a simple (low complexity) extension of LCC. The experiments presented in this paper demonstrate that RPCC enhances color correction performance on real and synthetic data.},

abstract = {The package REGULARIZATION TOOLS consists of 54 Matlab routines for analysis and solution of discrete ill-posed problems, i.e., systems of linear equations whose coefficient matrix has the properties that its condition number is very large, and its singular values decay gradually to zero. Such problems typically arise in connection with discretization of Fredholm integral equations of the first kind, and similar ill-posed problems. Some form of regularization is always required in order to compute a stabilized solution to discrete ill-posed problems. The purpose of REGULARIZATION TOOLS is to provide the user with easy-to-use routines, based on numerical robust and efficient algorithms, for doing experiments with regularization of discrete ill-posed problems. By means of this package, the user can experiment with different regularization strategies, compare them, and draw conclusions from these experiments that would otherwise require a major programming effert. For discrete ill-posed problems, which are indeed difficult to treat numerically, such an approach is certainly superior to a single black-box routine. This paper describes the underlying theory gives an overview of the package; a complete manual is also available.},
