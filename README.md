# CameraResponsePrediction

This project proposed a camera responses formation model, by which the camera responses under various capture settings can be predicted, given the spectral power distributions of captured targets.

The camera spectral sensitivity, crosstalk matrix and some nonlinear parameters are employed in this model.

The camera being mainly investigated was Nikon D3x.
